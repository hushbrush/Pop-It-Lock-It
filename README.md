# Pop-It-Lock-It


This project was jointly done by Harshita C(python), Lisa Sakai Quinley(javascript), and Shin Shunkyo(interface design) during the Parsons x Chiba University AI, Transformers, and Data Viz workshop. The current javascript prototype simply documents some of the visuals that came out of the project.
